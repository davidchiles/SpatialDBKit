SpatialDBKit
============

[![CI Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/davidchiles/SpatialDBKit.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/davidchiles/SpatialDBKit)

An Objective-C lightweight spatial RDBMS (based on SQLite/SpatiaLite).
The project manages a whole stack of technologies that allow combined together to perform spatial SQL queries (i.e. queries based on distance, intersection between geometries etc.) to obtain easy-to-use Cocoa objects.

While fully working, the project is in alpha stage, please be careful using this in production projects.

## Features ##

With SpatialDBKit you will be able to:

* Open a spatialite database:

```Objective-C
    // Open a spatialite database
    SpatialDatabase *db = [SpatialDatabase databaseWithPath: [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"test" ofType:@"sqlite"]];
    [db open];
```

* fetch geometries in form of Shapekit objects:

```Objective-C    
    FMResultSet *rs = [db executeQuery:@"select Name, geometry FROM Regions"];
        while ([rs next]) {
        NSLog(@"%@", [resultSet resultDictionary]);
    }
```    
    
* or in textual form:

```Objective-C    
    FMResultSet *rs = [db executeQuery:@"select Name, AsText(geometry) as geom_text FROM Regions"];
```

* calculating distance from a point if you need to:

```Objective-C    
    FMResultSet *rs = [db executeQuery:@"select distance(geometry, MakePoint(45.694216,9.676909,4326)) AS text FROM Regions"];
```

* or filtering points by distance:

```Objective-C    
    FMResultSet *resultSet= [db executeQuery:@"SELECT astext(geometry) as geometry, distance(geometry, MakePoint(45.694216,9.676909,4326)) as geometry, Name FROM Towns where distance(geometry, MakePoint(45.694216,9.676909,4326)) < 5000"];
```


This is just the point of the iceberg.. check [spatialite SQL functions reference list](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index) to be sure you don't miss anything of this awesome library!

## How to use it ##

Since importing C libraries is a sort of nightmare, SpatialDBKit has been thought to be used with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) that should address all the boring stuff for you.
But before you must install the [GNU build system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) if you haven't already:

```
brew install automake autoconf libtool
```

Now you can create your Podfile as usual: 

```
platform :ios, '5.0'
pod 'SpatialDBKit'
```

Of course now you should ```#import <SpatialDBKit/SpatialDatabase.h>```

Now ___two extra step are required___: 

1. rename your main file main.m to main.mm 
The long story is that SpatialDBKit dependencies reside on C++ libraries, so we should tell the compiler that our project files should be treated as Objective-C++. The podspec correctly sets C++ Standard Library project's build setting to libstdc++ (GNU c++ standard library), but XCode 5.1 can't find any Objective-C++ file in the main project, so ignores the setting and links with libc++. Renaming a file with .mm extension does the trick.

2. manually open ```spatialite.c``` and replace (line 87):

```
#include <spatialite/spatialite.h>
```

with:

```
#include <spatialite/spatialite/spatialite.h>
```

This is a workaround to fix the issue tracked here: https://github.com/andreacremaschi/SpatialDBKit/issues/12 (while I figure out something better, or it is fixed in CocoaPods, or in the spatialite's pod specification).
